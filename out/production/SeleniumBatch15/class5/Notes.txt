Approach to select the check box single

1) Inspect the checkbox
2) Write down the correct locator in the DOM
3) Use find Element to find the check box
4) click on it


If I want to check that check box is selected or not?
    checkbox.isSelected(); ---> True (means selected)

Preferred approach when it comes to multiple checkboxes?
1) inspect them in the DOM
2) write the locator in such a way that it is able to select all the required checkboxes
3) use find Elements to get all those checkboxes
4) iterate through the list
5) while iteration look for your desired checkbox (inspect the DOM to see which information provides you the indication that this is your desired checkbox)
6) if conditions to make the selection

Drop down:

2 types:
    1) Single Select
    2) Multi Select

When it comes to drop down we have a class in Selenium that help us interact with them
    Select Class; --> in order to be able to use this class, your drop down must be made in the DOM using the SELECT tag

Approach:
1) inspect the Drop Down
2) check if it has the select tag
3) write dow the locator to find the WebElement drop down
4) Declare an object of the select class
5) use methods from select class to select the desired option.
---> selectByvisibleText();
            byValue();
            byIndex();

Multi Select drop down:
Approach:
1) inspect the drop down
2) check if it has the select tag
3) write down the locator to find the webelement drop down
4) Declare an object of the select class (pass the Web Element in the parameters)
5) use methods to select the desired  option


------------------------ Alerts -----------------------------
Alerts are the popup windows that appear and without dealing with them you can not
proceed on with doing anything else

you can not inspect them
 3 types of Alerts:
 1) Java script alerts --> using SwitchTo commands
 2) HTML based alerts/popups --> we can deal with how we deal with other WebElements
 3) Window based --> we can not deal with them using selenium

Java Script Alerts:
1) simple alert -->
2) confirmation alert -->
3) Prompt alert -->

you deal with all of them in the exact same way
