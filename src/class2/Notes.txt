 Locators -> there are 8, whenever we need to find a particular webElement, we use locators
 1. Id
 2. name
 3. className
 4. linkText --> they can oly be used with a link and it must have a text (a link is usually in the tag <a>)
 5. Xpath
 6. Css
 7. tagName -->
 8. partial linktext --> they can oly be used with a link and it must have a text (a link is usually in the tag <a>)

 why do we need 8 locators?
    - sometimes there might be a locator with duplicate value
    - sometimes the developers might not provide you will all the locators

 Important to remember when selecting a locators
    - if an attribute value has a number in it, it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator
