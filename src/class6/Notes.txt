Waits:
Implicit Wait --> it is going to wait for the WebElement to be found until the timeout
 Syntax:
         driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20, TimeUnits.SECONDS);

 approach:
 1) to declare them only once in the starting of your code ---> called Global Waits

Explicit Wait --> conditional wait
We git conditions:
        wait for the webelement to be visible
        wait for the webelement to be clickable
        wait for the webelement to be enabled


Todays class:
1) Switchto.windows();

2) Switchto.frame();
    Whenever there is some element in order to interact with it we need to shift the focus of the driver to that frame

driver.switchto.frame() ---> by Id or Name
by id or name
by index
by webelement

defaultcontent();

explicit wait;
 are they global?
 not global

 implicit waits
 global waits --> they are implemented automatically to the whole class

 implicit --> is going to wait until the webelement is found

 explicit wait:
 conditional waits
 is enabled
 is visible
